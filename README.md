# usa_cats-dogs
A python data project analyzing the number of cats and dogs in the USA.

This is my first python data analysis project attempted on my own. I obtained a dataset with the number of dog homes and cat homes in the U.S.A. and I wanted to answer the following questions about the dataset:

1. What states have the most dog-owner households? What states have the most cat-owner households?
2. What is the total dog and cat population by state?
3. What is the total dog and cat population of the entire USA?
4. What portion of households are pet-less households, cat-only households, dog-only households, and dog and cat households?
5. Do Americans show a preference for one pet over the other?

During this project, I utilized data cleaning, and data manipulation with pandas, and data visualization with matplotlib. I learned a lot conducting this project.
